        "Many people in this world seem to be wandering along a relationship borderlining 'friends' and 'lovers'--a borderline commonly known as the FRIEND ZONE. A tricky area for those who cannot really stay friends with their close friends nor move forward to be their friends' lovers. Palm (Naphat Siangsomboon) has been stuck in the FRIEND ZONE with his best friend Gink (Pimchanok Luevisadpaibul) for 10 years. During high school he tried to cross the line by confessing his feelings for her, but she simply rejected him with being friends is good enough.Since then, Palm and Gink have grown closer as true best friends. Every time Palm breaks up with one of his countless girlfriends, Gink will talk sense into him; every time Gink fights with her boyfriend Ted (Jason Young), no matter where she happens to be in Myanmar, Malaysia, or Hong Kong, she calls Palm, who uses his perks as a flight attendant to catch flights to be with her. Perhaps this excessive kindness makes Gink have a problem with Ted. One day, out of the blue, Gink asks Palm: \"Have you wondered--what if we were an item?"
            "Right then, sparks fly wildly inside Palm's mind: this might be his only chance to cross the borderline. But he has no way of knowing if leaving the FRIEND ZONE this time will lead him to the beginning of his romantic love life or to the end of his friendship with Gink forever."
